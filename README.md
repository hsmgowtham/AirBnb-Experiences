## Features

- Reusable components using props
- Dynamic creation of components from arrays
- Use of JavaScript inside JSX
- Mapping dynamic input data to JSX elements
- Destructuring props and using spread objects
- Dynamic conditional rendering of JSX

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS

## Learnings

While working on this project, I learned and implemented the following concepts:

- **Props for Reusable Components**: Understanding how to pass data to components using props to make them reusable across the application.
- **Creating Components from an Array**: Generating multiple components dynamically by mapping over an array.
- **JavaScript inside JSX**: Embedding JavaScript expressions within JSX to make the UI more dynamic.
- **Using Maps for Dynamic Data**: Utilizing JavaScript's map function to convert arrays of data into lists of JSX elements.
- **Destructuring Props and Spread Syntax**: Using destructuring to simplify props usage and the spread syntax to pass multiple properties conveniently.
- **Dynamic Conditional Rendering**: Implementing conditional rendering in JSX to display different UI elements based on the application state.

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Update Your System

Before installing React, ensure your system is updated:

```sh
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade
```

### 2. Install Node.js

Install Node.js, which is required to run React applications:

```sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Check that the installation was successful by querying Node.js for its version number:

```sh
node -v
```

### 3. Install npm

In most cases, youâ€™ll also want to install npm, the Node.js package manager:

```sh
sudo apt install npm
```

You can verify the installation by checking npm's version:

```sh
npm -v
```

### 4. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-experiences-clone.git
```

### 5. Install Dependencies

Navigate into the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```sh
cd airbnb-experiences-clone
npm install
```

### 6. Start the React App

Start the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Your React app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

After following the installation guide, you can explore the different features and components of the AirBnB Experiences clone. Modify the components and data to see how changes are reflected in the UI dynamically.
